## ManulToken ERC-20 
This is a faster implementation of an ERC-20 token named AutoToke (symbol: AT) using the OpenZeppelin ERC-20 library that should conform to the [ERC-20 specification](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20).

## Getting Started
If you would like to deploy AutoToken, on either Localhost or Rinkeby, run one of the below commands. For Rinkeby deployment, create a .env with the Rinkeby URL and key. See hardhat.config.js for the naming of these environment variables.

Localhost
```bash
hh node
```
Rinkeby: 
```bash
hh deploy --network rinkeby
```
